# Regression Only Repo
### TO DOs
Conversion of train_block.py to a class structure, so we can instantiate the class for standalone inference.
Onnx conversion added to inference script.
Conversion from custom to more modern graphnets packages (or pytorch)

### Introduction
The idea of this repo is to learn a regression model conditioned on detector properties.  This can then be combined with a post-hoc optimizer.  The followup to this will be the combination of a regression model and a generative model.


### Running Simple NN
The functions folders contains .py files related to plotting and clustering cells. The training folder contains python scripts for running a simple Neural-Network. It is used for quick initial testing of inputs, and for experimentation (for example, the first variations of z-layering)

### Deep Sets Training
The train_block.py is a training script for DeepSets and GNNs (coming soon). It's primary advantage is its ability to train on input data in a permutation invariant way. The GNNs can also directly encode geometric data.

To run `train_block.py` for the first time, go to the `configs` directory, and either edit `default.yaml`, or add your own.
In the configuration file, make sure `data_dir` points to a directory with appropriated data, created using the [generate_data](https://github.com/eiccodesign/generate_data) repository, ideally in the form of several small ROOT files, each with a few thousand events.

Next, edit `already_preprocessed` in the config file to `False` only when running over a dataset for the first time. Afterwards, try running the training:

```python train_block.py```
or 
```python train_block.py --config [config file name]```

One may need to limit `num_procs` and `batch_size` according to what their computer can handle.

### MISC
There is a deprecated folder that, as the name suggests, should not be used anymore, and will be deleted soon. 
The pfn training script is located in the training folder, and should be runable from there.
